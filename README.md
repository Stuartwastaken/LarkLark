# 🐦 LarkLark Language

Welcome to the LarkLark programming language, where you _chirp_ and _tweet_ to write your code! LarkLark is a bird-inspired language designed for bird-lovers, bird-watchers, and programmers who want to have a little fun in their coding journey.

## 📜 Introduction

In the world of LarkLark, you get to write code like a bird. Use bird calls to define variables, print expressions, create loops, and define functions. Get ready to _tweet_, _chirp_, _caw_, _chirr_, and _hoot_ your way through coding!

## 🐤 Language Syntax

Here are some of the basic commands in the LarkLark language:

- `tweet x = 5`: Assign the value 5 to the variable `x`.
- `chirp x`: Print the value of variable `x`.
- `caw i squack 10 { chirp i }`: A for loop that iterates 10 times and prints the value of `i` each time.
- `chirr add(a, b) { tweet result = a + b; chirp result }`: Define a function named `add` that adds two numbers and prints the result.
- `hoot add(3, 4)`: Call the `add` function with the arguments 3 and 4.

## 🌳 LarkLark Interpreter

LarkLark comes with its own interpreter to execute your bird-inspired code. Simply write your code in a `.lark` file and let the interpreter take flight!

## 🎉 Getting Started

Ready to start coding like a bird? Follow these steps:

1. Clone the LarkLark repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/LarkLark.git`
2. Navigate to the LarkLark directory: `cd LarkLark`
3. Write your LarkLark code in a `.lark` file, for example: `nano hello.lark`
4. Run the LarkLark interpreter to execute your code: `python main.py hello.lark`
5. Watch your code take flight and enjoy the chirping!

## 🕊️ Examples

Here's an example LarkLark program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10:

```
tweet sum = 0
caw i squack 10 {
tweet sum = sum + i
}
chirp sum
```
